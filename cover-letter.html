        Hiring Manager<br />
        Mobile Health Consumer
      </p>
      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
      <p>
        I am writing to express my interest in the Customer Support –
        Information Technology position at Mobile Health Consumer. As a veteran
        of the U.S. Air Force currently earning my Bachelor of Science in
        Information Technology from Western Governors University, I bring a
        disciplined, solutions-focused mindset along with a passion for
        improving user experiences through technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my 19-year military career, I led and supported diverse teams
        in high-pressure environments while also developing a strong technical
        aptitude. I’m currently expanding that knowledge through hands-on
        projects in my home lab using Windows and Linux systems, and I’ve passed
        the Core 2 portion of the CompTIA A+ certification. I am confident in my
        ability to quickly develop subject matter expertise and communicate
        complex technical issues clearly to both technical and non-technical
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am especially drawn to Mobile Health Consumer’s mission to improve
        access, affordability, and engagement in healthcare. The opportunity to
        contribute to a growing, forward-thinking team while expanding my skills
        in IT support, QA, and product development is exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to
        support your team and grow with your organization.
      </p>
